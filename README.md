# ToDoList
# LGM TASK1

Its a to-do list app using React. 
The todo list items are listed in JSON type. 
Each todo item will be an object with three properties: id, task and complete which holds whether the task is completed or not.

Once a new task is added, a new todo object is created, push it into the array and render the value of the text property on the screen. When a todo is marked as 
completed, we’ll toggle the checked property to true, and when the user deletes a todo, we’ll locate the todo item in the array using its id and remove it.
